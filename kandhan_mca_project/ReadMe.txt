**A Facial Recognition Approach to Preventing Driver Drowsiness and Yawning**

This project uses facial recognition to detect and prevent driver drowsiness and yawning using Python, Dlib, OpenCV, and face_recognition libraries.

#Installation

1. Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Place images of the drivers to be recognized in the "faces" folder.

3. Run the program

python main.py


Code Structure:

* main.py: The main script to run the drowsiness and yawning detection program.

* requirements.txt: A list of all the Python libraries required to run this project.

* faces/: A directory where you should place the images of the drivers or persons to be recognized.

* haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml: The XML file for face detection.

* shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat: The data file for detecting facial landmarks.
